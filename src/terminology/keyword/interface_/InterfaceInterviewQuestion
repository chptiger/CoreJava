Interface Interview Question

1. what's interface?
	Interface is not a class.
    Interface is a blueprint for your class that can be used to implement a class; 
	Interface could have concrete method(default and static) --> Java 8
	
2. When to use interface?
   
   What your interface can have is static members and method signature.
   ex:
   public interface Brain {
   	public static final int number = 1;
   	public void talk(String name);
   	public abstract void doProgramming();// interface is not a class, we declare a abstract method inside class, we must make the class abstract;
   }
   
3. How to use interface?

4. Could you provide an example with it?

5. Why use abstract method inside the interface?
 	abstract is redundant in this case. All methods defined on an interface are public and abstract by definition.
 	Every method declaration in the body of an interface is implicitly abstract, so its body is always represented by a semicolon, not a block.
 	Every method declaration in the body of an interface is implicitly public.
