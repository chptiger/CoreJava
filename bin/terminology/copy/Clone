Not all the objects in java are eligible for cloning process. The objects which implement Cloneable interface are only eligible for cloning process.

What's Cloning?
Cloning is a process of creating an exact copy of an existing object in the memory. 
In java, clone() method of java.lang.Object class is used for cloning process. 
This method creates an exact copy of an object on which it is called through field-by-field assignment and returns the reference of that object. 
Not all the objects in java are eligible for cloning process. The objects which implement Cloneable interface are only eligible for cloning process. 
Cloneable interface is a marker interface which is used to provide the marker to cloning process. Click here to see more info on clone() method in java.


Deep Copy:
Deep copy of an object will have exact copy of all the fields of original object just like shallow copy. 
But in additional, if original object has any references to other objects as fields, then copy of those objects are also created by calling clone() method on them.

To create a deep copy of an object, you have to override the clone() method

Shallow Copy:
The default version of clone() method creates the shallow copy of an object.
