Abstraction Interview Question

1. What's abstract ?
	The abstract keyword can only be used on classes and methods in java. 
	An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract -- it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract class can not be instantiated, buy they can be subclassed.
	An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation(without braces, and followed by a semicolon)
	If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself must be declared abstract.
	When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class. However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.
	Note: 
		Methods in an interface that are not declared as default or static are implicitly abstract, so the abstract modifier is not used with interface methods(It can be used, but not necessary).
2. When to use abstract?

3. How to use abstract?
	An abstract class can not be instantiated and an abstract method can have no implementation.
	When a class is declared with abstract keyword then that particular class can not be instantiated. 
	It can only be extended and the all the methods of the abstract class needs to be implemented by the class which extends our abstract class.



6. Abstract classes compared to interfaces
	Abstract classes are similar to interfaces. You can not instantiate them, and they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation.

9. 
 
1. If we have declared a method as abstract then you must declare the class as abstract, abstract method can not be present in a non-abstract class.
2. Abstract class can have concrete methods(non-abstract) as well
3. Abstract method should not have implementation
4. Abstract method declaration should end with a semicolon(;)
5. The class extending the abstract class should implement all the abstract methods.
