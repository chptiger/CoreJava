Marker interfaces in java are interfaces with no members declared in them. 

They are just an empty interfaces used to mark or identify a special operation. 

For example, Cloneable interface is used to mark cloning operation and Serializable interface is used to mark serialization and deserialization of an object. 
Marker interfaces give instructions to JVM that classes implementing them will have special behavior and must be handled with care.
